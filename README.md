# Expense Tracker

Source Code of the App I coded after/while watching this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu6fAlltatA).

I built the app in iOS 15 and Swift UI.

This app is different than the usual way I build it.

Here I am building an app without the help of a storyboard.

Pure coding stuff!
